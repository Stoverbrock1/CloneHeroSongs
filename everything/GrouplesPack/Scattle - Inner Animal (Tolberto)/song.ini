loading_phrase = A top down game that's gameplay and soundtrack caught my attention pretty quick after I watched Ray Narvaez Jr. play it. First game like this that I played that wasn't on a flash player, and I had a blast with it. Soundtrack is a banger, and it's mentally unstable character, "Jacket", was quite the introduction to people dressing like animals. I'll keep the animal masks to my murder sprees only, thank you very much.
