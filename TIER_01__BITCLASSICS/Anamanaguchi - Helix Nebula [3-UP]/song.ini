loading_phrase = The origin of the band's name still remains unclear. In a lot of interviews, one possible origin is that their name came about after the members worked as interns at Armani, Prada, Gucci while studying fashion before majoring in Music Technology. People began calling them the "Armani-Prada-Gucci boys", which eventually was elided into "Anamanaguchi".
