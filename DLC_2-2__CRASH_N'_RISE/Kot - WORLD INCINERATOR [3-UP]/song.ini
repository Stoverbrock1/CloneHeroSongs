loading_phrase = The Konami VRC7 expansion chip adds FM sound to the NES/Famicom. It's a very cut down version of other FM chips available at the time, only being able to customize 1 out of its 16 built-in instruments. Still doesn't stop people from making wild bangers with it though.<br><br><b>BASED chart is available under "Guitar Coop"</b>
