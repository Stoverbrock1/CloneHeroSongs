loading_phrase = <size=16><br>Death Grips is an American experimental hip hop group formed in 2010 in Sacramento, California. The group consists of Stefan Burnett, also known as MC Ride (vocals, lyrics), Zach Hill (drums, production, lyrics), and Andy Morin (keyboards, production, lyrics). Though he is not the group's frontman, Hill has been credited with being the driving creative force behind the project. Drawing from punk rock, electronic, noise, and industrial styles, the band's innovative and often difficult-to-categorize sound has earned critical acclaim and a cult following, while their aggressive performance style and cryptic interactions with their fans and the media have gained widespread notoriety.<br><br>A song loosely about drug addiction and the attributes that follow.<br>The title “Lil Boy” is also a reference to the USA’s bomb dropped in Hiroshima (Japan) in 1945, named “Little Boy”. You can see that by Ride mentioning “burn through it” and “face of a woman; tears of a child”.
