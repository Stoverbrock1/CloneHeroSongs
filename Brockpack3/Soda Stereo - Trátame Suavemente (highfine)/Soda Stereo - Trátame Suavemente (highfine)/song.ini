loading_phrase = <i>"Trátame Suavemente"</i> was written by keyboardist and friend of the band Daniel Melero, who would later record his own version with his band "Los Encargados" in 1986. The ballad soon became a massive hit in Argentina and neighbouring countries. Despite being written to appear as a love ballad, it's actually a strong bash against Leopoldo Galtieri, Argentina's last military dictator, who would end up declaring war on the UK to try and take over the Falkland islands.
