loading_phrase = Steel Mogu and Clear Tamei are Iglooghost’s back-to-back follow ups to his acclaimed full-length debut Neō Wax Bloom. As ever, the releases are bundled with multimedia storyline material that feed into Iglooghost’s ever-expanding narrative - giving longtime fans their first glimpse into the primordial era of the Mamu dimension. <br>The double features are set in Mamu, 3000 years prior to the events of ‘Neō Wax Bloom.’ We are introduced to a young, see-through, god in-training named Tamei. Although a gifted, he and his little cohorts resent their fate of becoming Grid Göds - and find themselves wound up in a hyperspeed, cross-temporal battle with a fleet of mysterious, round beings.
