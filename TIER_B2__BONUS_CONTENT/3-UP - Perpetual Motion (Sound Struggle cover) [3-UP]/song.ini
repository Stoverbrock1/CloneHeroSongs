loading_phrase = While I have dabbled with making covers in Famitracker for years, I've only recently gotten the motivation to do them again, partially thanks to a new DAW that came out called <i>FamiStudio</i>, which features a UI similar to what more modern DAWs use nowadays. Ever since I came back to play Burple's chart of this song, it became one of my favorites, and so I wanted to try my hand at a NES-style cover of it.
