loading_phrase = Out of all the home computers, the Commodore 64 has one of the most active demo and music scenes, thanks in part due to how many tricks and optimizations have been found for the machine over the years. Only on the C64 will you find a funky Daft Punk-style tune with vocoder lyrics on an 8-bit machine.
