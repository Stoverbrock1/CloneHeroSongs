loading_phrase = The ZX Spectrum originally came with just a single piezoelectric speaker, only outputting 1-voice square waves. You could however make your beeps shorter than a full wavelength, and if you made them as thin as possible, you are able to fit in multiple audio channels without them interfering each other. To quote Tim himself: "The only drawback was that it sounded like a vacuum cleaner with nails stuck in it.".<br><br><b>Unnerfed chart is available under "Guitar Coop"</b>
