loading_phrase = PandaTracker was a tracker made by setrodox in 2007, intended to be easy to use for One Hour Battles. The project didn't go very far and has been long abandoned since. Trying to use it nowadays is anything but easy, but despite this, PandaTracker still occasionally shows up for competitions on Battle of the Bits.
