loading_phrase = I was shocked to see that 3-UP charted Opus I - We Were Younger by Flaminglog for Bitcrusher, due to the coincidental fact that Flaminglog is actually a friend of mine that I personally know and occasionally talk with. Flaminglog's song Opus VI - Rain was one of the main sources of inspiration for <i>A New World</i>.<br><br><b>Unnerfed chart is available under "Guitar Coop"</b>
