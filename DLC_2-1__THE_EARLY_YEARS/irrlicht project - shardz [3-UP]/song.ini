loading_phrase = The Fairchild Channel F is the first video game console to use interchangeable cartridges. It also has the most rudimentary audio imaginable, only having a single audio channel that can generate 3 tones! If you use all of the CPU's runtime though, you can squeeze in 4 audio channels with a much wider pitch range.
