loading_phrase = Korean musician Parannoul came out of nowhere to hit the forefront of the indie scene with the 2021 release of <i>To See the Next Part of the Dream</i>, a raw and confessional shoegaze work created as if driven by sheer will to make something in his life change - a sentiment that clearly resonated in the hearts of many dreamers, no better conveyed than by the haunting piano ostinato of "Beautiful World."
