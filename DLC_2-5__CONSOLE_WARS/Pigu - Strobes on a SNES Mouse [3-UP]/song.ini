loading_phrase = While most Mario Paint covers use some variation of Mario Paint Composer, this song sticks to the limitations of the original Mario Paint on SNES, which includes only using white keys, only 3 notes at once, and much fewer tempo options. Oh, and your songs could only hold 24 bars, but let's just pretend we load in several songs back to back.
