loading_phrase = The story behind the album is about how little Tommy acquired an enchanted cartridge after defeating his game genie. When he turned his NES on with the cartridge inside, the words "PREPARE TO JAM" appeared onscreen. Once grabbing his brother's keyboard, his fingers suddenly started playing tunes from his favorite games and his system started playing along with him. These are the tape recordings from that jam session, released to the public after 20 years.
