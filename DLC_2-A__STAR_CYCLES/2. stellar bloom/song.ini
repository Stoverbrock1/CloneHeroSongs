loading_phrase = This song was written in tandem with the first track, and builds on some of robotmeadows' earlier attempts at creating full sounding rock songs on a Game Boy. With only so few audio channels to work with, it can be frustrating to fit in all the parts you want, but this limitation also makes every single choice you make more purposeful.<br><br><b>Unnerfed chart is available under "Guitar Coop"</b>
