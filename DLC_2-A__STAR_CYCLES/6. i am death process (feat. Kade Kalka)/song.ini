loading_phrase = This song takes heavy inspirations from bands like The Human Abstract and Protest the Hero, and is also the only song on the album to include a drum solo. Originally, the album was gonna be a solo project focused on pure Game Boy music, but as time went on, robotmeadows felt like this song demanded a shredding guitar solo.<br><br><b>Unnerfed chart is available under "Guitar Coop"</b>
