loading_phrase = Most of music Jake Kaufman made was done using a program called <i>Impulse Tracker</i>. While it's a more general sample-based tracker, it was capable of making music with the same restrictions that the NES had. It wouldn't be until FX4 that Jake would switch to using <i>Famitracker</i>, which allows you to make music that can run on real NES hardware.<br><br><b>Unnerfed chart is available under "Guitar Coop"</b>
